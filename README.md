My Casino Game running on C, currently on works on a Console, if it's feasible i might add UI to it...
As of right now only Blackjack is fully functional, working on Poker with Multiplayer, so might be a while until an update is thrown out...

I am a newbie to programming. This is just for me to learn and understand the Language and Programming concepts in general.

You should be able to build this on Windows AND on Linux.
